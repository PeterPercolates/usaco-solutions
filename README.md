# usaco-solutions
This is a repositity loaded with my responses to various different USACO problems, i will continue updating and adding more solutions as i do more and more of them myself
# Notes
 - All my responses are made in java, using PrintWriter and BufferedReader, all my solutions will be stored in `main.java`
 - Some folders may contain a `*.in` or a `*.out` file, these are just the test file that have been used for testing correctness.
