# Notes
 - All my responses are made in java, using PrintWriter and BufferedReader, all my solutions will be stored in `main.java`
 - Some folders may contain a `*.in` or a `*.out` file, these are just the test file that have been used for testing correctness.
# Useful Resources
- Some of my questions will be from [usaco.guide], if you want more materials in addition to a path that teaches you what you need to know then definitely check it out.
